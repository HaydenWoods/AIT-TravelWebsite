# Applied Information Technology Travel Website
###### Hayden Woods - 2018 - Ms Vettler

## Scenario
>In this task, you will be required to design and develop a web page to be included on a local travel agent’s web site.  The manager of the travel agent was impressed with your video, and would now like you to create a web page dedicated to this special tour.  The web page should include essential information about places to see, activities to be involved in, special events etc.  As this web page will contain the video you created for this tour, it should provide more information on the places and activities highlighted in the video.  You will need to utilise a range of digital applications to develop your solution such as, graphic and animation production, audio and video editing, web page authoring tools and the many peripheral (hardware) devices available.  The web page needs to ‘fit’ the style of the travel agency’s current web site, whilst seizing the attention of the specific audience.  The goal of the website is to attract more sales for the tour.
